Welcome to the FinTech Repository of my FinTech projects. Feel free to explore.

Triple hyphens helps add these lines you see above the text you are reading

*By enclosing a text between a pair of single asterisk we can italisize the text*

**By enclosing a text between a pair of double asterisk we can make the text bold**

A `print`  function in Python displays the text or variable passed in the function as output (the word print is displayed as such by enclosing the word between a pair of back ticks):

We can create a code block like the one displayed below by opening the code content with "three backticks `python`" and ending the code block with "three backticks". The use of the word `python` above aides the color coding of the code block for easy reading. The code block can be created even without the word `python`

```python
text = ‘This is a sentence that you would like to display.’
print(text)
```

The block quote below was created by using > in the beginning of the quote

>...."dare to think big but stay humble"

For creating the hyperlinks below we use the format "[text](destination location based on the location of the readme file)"

[Programs](code) : [Input Files](resources) : [Results](output)

For the image inserted below we use the syntax "! [text/alt text] (url)" (no spaces). The URL needs to be a location within the repository along with the file name. 'text/alt text' seems to be a description of the image which is not expected to show up on the markdown preview ***(I am unsure about this)***.
